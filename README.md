# Bling R Us Pricing and Engraving Calculator

This Python script calculates the total cost of an order for Bling R Us, based on a set of products with predefined base prices, engraving specifications, discounts, VAT, and shipping rules. This draft version was created as a testing solution for the Bling R Us websiteâ€™s pricing system, with the potential to be further developed for automated testing using Selenium WebDriver.

## Challenge Context
