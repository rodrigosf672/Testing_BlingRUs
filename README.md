# Testing_BlingRUs

Challenge based on the following website: https://blingrus.azurewebsites.net. Challenge involved testing the pricing system of the website. 

This Python script is a draft that could be used to conduct testing on the Bling R Us website using Selenium. This is a very primitive version which intends to demonstrate that it is possible to provide the desired outputs for the website, based on the engraving and pricing rules provided. 

By performing modifications to this script and combining it with Selenium webdriver and other functions, it could be possible to automate the testing of the website and shopping cart functionalities.
